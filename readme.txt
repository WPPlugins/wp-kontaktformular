An really simple contact form plugin. Just type [contact] to use it. There are no options at all

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is there a version with a reCaptcha? =
Sorry, not at the moment.

= How do I set the options? =
You don't. There are no options. There's plenty of fancy, bloated contact form plugins out there you can use if you want options. This one works everytime with zero configuration.

= Where does the email go? =
To the administrator email address. You can change this in WordPress' general settings if you need to.

= Why did you make this? =
There were no good, up-to-date lightweight contact form plugins.

== Screenshots ==
1. The message when one of the requried fields (return email address or message) is omitted.
